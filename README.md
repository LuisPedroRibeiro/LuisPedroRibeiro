### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is LuÃ­s Ribeiro and I am a 19 year old Software Engineer student. Currently, I am studying at **ISEP** (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto) in Porto, Portugal.

* Programming Languages: Java, C and SQL.
* Languages: Portuguese (Native) and English (Fluent).

#### More About Me

I am from Vila do Conde, a small portuguese town, and I have a passion for computers, programming and engineering in general. Some of my favourite hobbies are programming, playing basketball, playing videogames and going out with friends.

I would say that my main goal is getting into the Game Development Industry, because it is something that is interesting for me and I would like to make games that will make the people who play them happy.
