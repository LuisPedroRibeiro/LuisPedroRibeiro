### About Me ðŸ¤™ 

Hello, my name is LuÃ­s Ribeiro and I am a 19 year old Software Engineer student, welcome to my GitHub page!
At this moment I am studying Software Engineering at ISEP (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto) in Porto, Portugal.

I am looking foward to ending the Degree and starting a Master Degree's, with it being either on Artificial Intelligence or on Software Development.
Another possibility for my future would be studying about Game Development, because it was always an area of Informatics that interested me.

* Programming Languages: Java, JavaScript (and TypeScript), C, Prolog, SQL, HTML (with CSS).
* Skills: PlantUML (Design), Markdown, Scrum, PowerPoint and Excel.
* Languages: Portuguese (Native) and English (Fluent).

### What am I doing? ðŸŽ¯

At this moment I am developing Software on a University Project.
After finishing this Project (and finishing the Final Exams), I will proceed to create a small website (making use of JavaScript) and some applications (still to be decided).
